## Meeting February 21th 2017

Persons Attending: Eric Van Wyk, Will Croteau, Patrick Stephen

1.  Went over the sieve, select and overload examples. Explained the bug that overload demonstrates,
    and how a buffered channel implementation would avoid it. Planned to go over these examples with
    the full group this Thursday, along with the channel implementation.
    
2.  Discussed some early difficulties understanding some Silver code. Planned to produce abstract
    productions for the package for next week.
